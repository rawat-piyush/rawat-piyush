Hello, I am Piyush, an industrial engineer in the making and an aspiring data scientist. 
- I’m interested in predictive analytics and the use of ANNs and how to incorporate this in sports betting or sports in general (ex: scouting for a football player).
- I’m currently learning about investemnts & financing and how to use alogrithms for trading (stocks, commodities etc.).
- My other areas of interests include operations research, optimization and econometrics. 
- My upcoming projects:
  - Algo Trading: Developing quantitative strategies for trading gold based on the Iranian gold price dataset.
  - Customer Churn: Building a machine learning model to predict customer churn for a satellite navigation app.

Keep visting for new updates :)
